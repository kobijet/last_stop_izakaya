# Last Stop Izakaya

It's late, and it's been a long week. You have a couple hours to kill before the last ferry leaves for the city. Why not settle in and grab a bite to eat, perhaps a drink, and rest easy for a while at the Last Stop Izakaya.

## Overview

This is a website made for a fictional restauraunt, 'Last Stop Izakaya.' They are a local business serving up authentic Japanese ramen, other cuisine, as well as a drinks from a full-service bar.

The team at 'Last Stop' are looking to update their rather plain website to something that will better catch people's eye and provide them quickly with the information they need. They have a particular interest in being able to update their menu regularly and without much hassel.
